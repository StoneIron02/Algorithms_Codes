# Template

&nbsp;&nbsp;You should satisfy the template below. Else, satisfy at least the contents below. If you want to add some contents in your description, please tell me why the content have to be added. It would be nice if the decription suggested by you is more detailed, but if the quantity of contents you add is too much to read simply, we cannot review the algorithm in less time when we need that to study more high-level algorithms.

- The bolded texts and markdown keywords below are have to be written.
- Other texts are just descirptions about what should be contained.
---
1. The name of Algorithm
	> <b>- Contributor:</b> github nickname who write this.
	> <b>- Reference:</b> the books, papers or etc that you refernece.
	> <b>- Time complexity:</b> time compelxity of the algorithm with big-O notation.
    > <b>- Space complexity:</b> space compelxity of the algorithm with big-O notation.
	> &nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract of the algorithm.
