## Outline

&nbsp;&nbsp;This repository contains the source codes about implementation of some algorithms or data structurses that I need to know to study something about an algorithm. The source codes are written by me, referencing the original paper sugesting the source codes ore some papers referencing the original paper.

## Algorithms
&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementations of Algorithms using C++.
### Pattern Matching
---
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattern matching problem is the problem that finds multiple or single pattern in multiple of single given text.

	> - Time complexity: (implementation: array) <br/>preprocessing by all patterns to construct the automata, including the trie, failure func and output func, needs time linear to sum the length of all patterns. And, Searching patterns in a given text needs time linear to the length of the text. If the sum of the length of all patterns is <i>m</i>, the alphabet used in the text is constant, and the length of the text is <i>n</i>, then the time complexity of this algorithm is $$O(m  + n)$$
	> - Space complexity: The number of nodes and edges of the automata is at most the sum of the length of patterns. And, the failure function can be stored as a linear array. If the patterns consist of only one character and their length are differnet from each other, the output function returns all patterns whose length is shorter than the new pattern founded. $$O(m^2)$$
	> &nbsp;&nbsp; Aho-Corasck Automata is the deterministic automata to find all location of multiple patterns in a given text. Preprocessing patterns constructs the automata looked like a trie. Next, put a give text, the string in which we want to find patterns, in the automata.
